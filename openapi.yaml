    The GBIF API is a RESTful JSON based API. The base URL for v1 you should use is: http://api.gbif.org/v1/

    The API should be considered stable, as should this accompanying documentation. It is also available with HTTPS. Please report any issues you find with either the API itself or the documentation using the "feedback" button on the top right.

      The API is split into logical sections to ease understanding
      - Registry: Provides means to create, edit, update and search for information about the datasets, organizations (e.g. data publishers), networks and the means to access them (technical endpoints). The registered content controls what is crawled and indexed in the GBIF data portal, but as a shared API may also be used for other initiatives
      - Species: Provides services to discover and access information about species and higher taxa, and utility services for interpreting names and looking up the identifiers and complete scientific names used for species in the GBIF portal.
      - Occurrence: Provides access to occurrence information crawled and indexed by GBIF and search services to do real time paged search and asynchronous download services to do large batch downloads.
      - Maps: Provides simple services to show the maps of GBIF mobilized content on other sites.
      - News: Provides services to stream useful information such as papers published using GBIF mobilized content for various themes.

      # Communication
      You can sign up to the GBIF API users mailing list to post your questions, and to keep informed about the API. We will announce new versions, and scheduled maintenance downtimes before they happen.

      We welcome any example uses of the API to guest feature on the GBIF data blog.

      Feedback from developers on the API can be sent to informatics@gbif.org

      # Range queries
      
      Some search parameters support range queries, for example the year parameter in the occurrence search. In general ranges are given as a single parameter value by concatenating a lower and an upper value with a comma. For example: `http://api.gbif.org/v1/occurrence/search?year=1800,1899`

      # Authentication
      POST, PUT, and DELETE requests require authentication. The GBIF API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with any GBIF user account that you have created before.

      For example to issue a new download programmatically using curl with a query filter as JSON in a file called filter.json: 
      ```
      $ curl -i --user yourUserName:yourPassword -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST -d @filter.json http://api.gbif.org/v1/occurrence/download/request
      ```

      # Roadmap to v2
      The GBIF API is currently at v1 which means:

      The API is stable â€“ this means we won't rename or remove any REST resources or response properties to ensure backwards compatibility, but we might add new resources to the API. Any additions will be announced via the API mailing list.
      Any bug fixes or additions will result in minor version changes which are not reflected in the API URL, only in the documentation and our Java client code.
      If and when the need for breaking changes arises we will document our intent here and on the mailing list, and give considerable warning before moving to a future v2.
      The base URL includes the version as appropriate.

  - name: Dataset
    description: |
      The dataset API provides CRUD and discovery services for datasets. Its most prominent use on the GBIF portal is to drive the dataset search and dataset pages.
      Please note deletion of datasets is logical, meaning dataset entries remain registered forever and only get a deleted timestamp. On the other hand, deletion of a dataset's contacts, endpoints, identifiers, tags, machine tags, comments, and metadata descriptions is physical, meaning the entries are permanently removed.
